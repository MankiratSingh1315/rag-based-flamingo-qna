The Last Lesson is set in the\\ndays of the Franco-Prussian W ar (1870-1871) in which\\nFrance was defeated by Prussia led by Bismarck.\\nPrussia then consisted of what now are the nations of\\nGermany, Poland and parts of Austria. In this story the\\nFrench districts of Alsace and Lorraine have passed\\ninto Prussian hands. Read the story to find out what\\neffect this had on life at school.\\nNotice these expressions in the text.\\nInfer their meaning from the context\\n/circle5in great dread of /circle5in unison\\n/circle5counted on /circle5a great bustle\\n/circle5thumbed at the edges /circle5reproach ourselves with\\nI started for school very late that morning and was in great\\ndread of a scolding, especially because M. Hamel had said\\nthat he would question us on participles, and I did not\\nknow the first word about them. For a moment I thought of\\nrunning away and spending the day out of doors. It was so\\nwarm, so bright! The birds were chirping at the edge of the\\nwoods; and in the open field back of the sawmill the\\nPrussian soldiers were drilling. It was all much more\\ntempting than the rule for participles, but I had the\\nstrength to resist, and hurried off to school.\\nWhen I passed the town hall there was a crowd in\\nfront of the bulletin-board. For the last two years all our\\nbad news had come from there — the lost battles, the draft,\\nthe orders of the commanding officer — and I thought to\\nmyself, without stopping, “What can be the matter now?”1\\nReprint 2024-25\\n', 'The Last Lesson /3\\nThen, as I hurried by as fast as I could go, the\\nblacksmith, W achter , who was ther e, with his appr entice,\\nreading the bulletin, called after me, “Don’t go so fast,\\nbub; you’ll get to your school in plenty of time!”\\nI thought he was making fun of me, and reached\\nM. Hamel’s little garden all out of breath.\\nUsually, when school began, there was a great bustle,\\nwhich could be heard out in the street, the opening and\\nclosing of desks, lessons repeated in unison, very loud, with\\nour hands over our ears to understand better , and the\\nteacher’s great ruler rapping on the table. But now it was\\nall so still! I had counted on the commotion to get to my\\ndesk without being seen; but, of course, that day everything\\nhad to be as quiet as Sunday morning. Through the window\\nI saw my classmates, already in their places, and M. Hamel\\nwalking up and down with his terrible iron ruler under his\\narm. I had to open the door and go in befor e everybody. Y ou\\ncan imagine how I blushed and how frightened I was.\\nBut nothing happened. M. Hamel saw me and said\\nvery kindly, “Go to your place quickly, little Franz. W e wer e\\nbeginning without you.”\\nI jumped over the bench and sat down at my desk. Not\\ntill then, when I had got a little over my fright, did I see\\nthat our teacher had on his beautiful green coat, his frilled\\nReprint 2024-25\\n', '4/Flamingo\\nshirt, and the little black silk\\ncap, all embroidered, that he\\nnever wore except on\\ninspection and prize days.\\nBesides, the whole school\\nseemed so strange and\\nsolemn. But the thing that\\nsurprised me most was to\\nsee, on the back benches that\\nwere always empty, the village\\npeople sitting quietly like\\nourselves; old Hauser , with\\nhis three-cornered hat, the\\nformer mayor , the for mer\\npostmaster , and several others besides. Everybody looked\\nsad; and Hauser had br ought an old primer , thumbed at\\nthe edges, and he held it open on his knees with his great\\nspectacles lying across the pages.\\nWhile I was wondering about it all, M. Hamel mounted\\nhis chair , and, in the same grave and gentle tone which he\\nhad used to me, said, “My children, this is the last lesson\\nI shall give you. The order has come from Berlin to teach\\nonly German in the schools of Alsace and Lorraine. The\\nnew master comes tomorrow. This is your last French\\nlesson. I want you to be very attentive.”\\nWhat a thunderclap these words were to me!\\nOh, the wretches; that was what they had put up at\\nthe town-hall!\\nMy last French lesson! Why, I hardly knew how to\\nwrite! I should never learn any more! I must stop there, then!\\nOh, how sorry I was for not learning my lessons, for seeking\\nbirds’ eggs, or going sliding on the Saar! My books, that had\\nseemed such a nuisance a while ago, so heavy to carry, my\\ngrammar , and my history of the saints, wer e old friends now\\nthat I couldn’t give up. And M. Hamel, too; the idea that he\\nwas going away, that I should never see him again, made me\\nforget all about his ruler and how cranky he was.\\nPoor man! It was in honour of this last lesson that he\\nhad put on his fine Sunday clothes, and now I understood\\nReprint 2024-25\\n', 'The Last Lesson /5\\nwhy the old men of the village were sitting there in the\\nback of the room. It was because they were sorry, too, that\\nthey had not gone to school more. It was their way of\\nthanking our master for his forty years of faithful service\\nand of showing their respect for the country that was theirs\\nno more.\\nWhile I was thinking of all this, I heard my name called.\\nIt was my turn to recite. What would I not have given to be\\nable to say that dreadful rule for the participle all through,\\nvery loud and clear , and without one mistake? But I got\\nmixed up on the first words and stood there, holding on to\\nmy desk, my heart beating, and not daring to look up.\\nI heard M. Hamel say to me, “I won’t scold you, little\\nFranz; you must feel bad enough. See how it is! Every day\\nwe have said to ourselves, ‘Bah! I’ve plenty of time. I’ll\\nlearn it tomorrow.’ And now you see where we’ve come out.\\nAh, that’s the great trouble with Alsace; she puts off\\nlearning till tomorrow. Now those fellows out there will\\nhave the right to say to you, ‘How is it; you pretend to be\\nFrenchmen, and yet you can neither speak nor write your\\nown language?’ But you are not the worst, poor little Franz.\\nWe’ve all a gr eat deal to r eproach ourselves with.”\\n“Your par ents wer e not anxious enough to have you\\nlearn. They preferred to put you to work on a farm or at\\nthe mills, so as to have a little more money. And I? I’ve\\nbeen to blame also. Have I not often\\nsent you to water my flowers\\ninstead of learning your\\nlessons? And when I\\nwanted to go fishing,\\ndid I not just give\\nyou a holiday?”\\nThen, from one\\nthing to another,\\nM. Hamel went on\\nto talk of the\\nFrench language,\\nsaying that it was\\nthe most beautiful\\nReprint 2024-25\\n', '6/Flamingo\\nSketch map not to scaleFrance\\n1870-71\\nReprint 2024-25\\n', 'The Last Lesson /7\\nlanguage in the world — the\\nclearest, the most logical; that\\nwe must guard it among us and\\nnever forget it, because when a\\npeople are enslaved, as long as\\nthey hold fast to their language\\nit is as if they had the key to their\\nprison. Then he opened a\\ngrammar and read us our lesson.\\nI was amazed to see how well I\\nunderstood it. All he said seemed\\nso easy, so easy! I think, too, that\\nI had never listened so carefully,\\nand that he had never explained\\neverything with so much patience.\\nIt seemed almost as if the poor\\nman wanted to give us all he knew\\nbefore going away, and to put it\\nall into our heads at one stroke.\\nAfter the grammar , we had a\\nlesson in writing. That day M.\\nHamel had new copies for us,\\nwritten in a beautiful round hand\\n— France, Alsace, France, Alsace. They looked like little\\nflags floating everywhere in the school-room, hung from\\nthe rod at the top of our desks. Y ou ought to have seen how\\nevery one set to work, and how quiet it was! The only sound\\nwas the scratching of the pens over the paper . Once some\\nbeetles flew in; but nobody paid any attention to them, not\\neven the littlest ones, who worked right on tracing their\\nfish-hooks, as if that was French, too. On the roof the\\npigeons cooed very low, and I thought to myself, “Will they\\nmake them sing in German, even the pigeons?”\\nWhenever I looked up from my writing I saw M. Hamel\\nsitting motionless in his chair and gazing first at one thing,\\nthen at another , as if he wanted to fix in his mind just how\\neverything looked in that little school-room. Fancy! For\\nforty years he had been there in the same place, with his\\ngarden outside the window and his class in front of him,\\n1.What was Franz expected to\\nbe prepared with for school\\nthat day?\\n2.What did Franz notice that was\\nunusual about the school that\\nday?\\n3.What had been put up on the\\nbulletin-board?\\nReprint 2024-25\\n', '8/Flamingo\\njust like that. Only the desks and benches had been worn\\nsmooth; the walnut-tr ees in the gar den wer e taller , and\\nthe hopvine that he had planted himself twined about the\\nwindows to the roof. How it must have broken his heart to\\nleave it all, poor man; to hear his sister moving about in\\nthe room above, packing their trunks! For they must leave\\nthe country next day.\\nBut he had the courage to hear every lesson to the\\nvery last. After the writing, we had a lesson in history,\\nand then the babies chanted their ba, be bi, bo, bu.  Down\\nthere at the back of the room old Hauser had put on his\\nspectacles and, holding his primer in both hands, spelled\\nthe letters with them. Y ou could see that he, too, was crying;\\nhis voice trembled with emotion, and it was so funny to\\nhear him that we all wanted to laugh and cry. Ah, how\\nwell I remember it, that last lesson!\\nAll at once the church-clock struck twelve. Then the\\nAngelus. At the same moment the trumpets of the\\nPrussians, returning from drill, sounded under our\\nwindows. M. Hamel stood up, very pale, in his chair .\\nI never saw him look so tall.\\n“My friends,” said he, “I—I—” But something choked\\nhim. He could not go on.\\nThen he turned to the blackboard, took a piece of chalk,\\nand, bearing on with all his\\nmight, he wrote as large as he\\ncould —\\n“Vive La France!”\\nThen he stopped and leaned\\nhis head against the wall, and,\\nwithout a word, he made a\\ngesture to us with his hand —\\n“School is dismissed — you\\nmay go.”\\n1.What changes did the order\\nfrom Berlin cause in school\\nthat day?\\n2.How did Franz’s feelings about\\nM.

But promises\\nlike mine abound in every corner of his bleak world.\\nAfter months of knowing him, I ask him his name.\\n“Saheb-e-Alam,” he announces. He does not know what it\\nmeans. If he knew its meaning — lord of the universe —\\nhe would have a hard time believing it. Unaware of what\\nhis name represents, he roams the streets with his friends,\\nan army of barefoot boys who appear like the morning birds\\nand disappear at noon. Over the months, I have come to\\nrecognise each of them.\\n“Why aren’t you wearing chappals ?” I ask one.\\n“My mother did not bring them down from the shelf,”\\nhe answers simply.\\n“Even if she did he will throw them off,” adds another\\nwho is wearing shoes that do not match. When I comment on\\nit, he shuffles his feet and says nothing. “I want shoes,” says\\na thir d boy who has never owned a pair all his life. T ravelling\\nacross the country I have seen children walking barefoot, in\\ncities, on village roads. It is not lack of money but a tradition\\nto stay barefoot, is one explanation. I wonder if this is only\\nan excuse to explain away a perpetual state of poverty.\\nI remember a story a man from Udipi once told me. As a\\nyoung boy he would go to school past an old temple, where\\nhis father was a priest. He would stop briefly at the temple\\nand pray for a pair of shoes. Thirty years later I visited his\\ntown and the temple, which was now drowned in an air of\\nReprint 2024-25\\n', 'Lost Spring /15\\ndesolation. In the backyard, where lived the new priest, there\\nwere red and white plastic chairs. A young boy dressed in a\\ngrey uniform, wearing socks and shoes, arrived panting and\\nthrew his school bag on a folding bed. Looking at the boy, I\\nremembered the prayer another boy had made to the goddess\\nwhen he had finally got a pair of shoes , “Let me never lose\\nthem.” The goddess had granted his prayer . Young boys like\\nthe son of the priest now wore shoes. But many others like\\nthe ragpickers in my neighbourhood remain shoeless.\\nMy acquaintance with the barefoot ragpickers leads\\nme to Seemapuri, a place on the periphery of Delhi yet miles\\naway from it, metaphorically. Those who live here are\\nsquatters who came from Bangladesh back in 1971. Saheb’s\\nfamily is among them. Seemapuri was then a wilderness. It\\nstill is, but it is no longer empty. In structures of mud, with\\nroofs of tin and tarpaulin, devoid of sewage, drainage or\\nrunning water , live 10,000 ragpickers. They have lived her e\\nfor more than thirty years without an identity, without\\npermits but with ration cards that get their names on voters’\\nlists and enable them to buy grain. Food is more important\\nfor survival than an identity. “If at the end of the day we\\ncan feed our families and go to bed without an aching\\nstomach, we would rather live here than in the fields that\\ngave us no grain,” say a group of women in tattered saris\\nwhen I ask them why they left their beautiful land of green\\nfields and rivers. Wherever they find food, they pitch their\\ntents that become transit homes. Children grow up in them,\\nbecoming partners in survival. And survival in Seemapuri\\nmeans rag-picking. Through the years, it has acquired the\\nproportions of a fine art. Garbage to them is gold. It is their\\ndaily bread, a roof over their heads, even if it is a leaking\\nroof. But for a child it is even more.\\n“I sometimes find a rupee, even a ten-rupee note,”\\nSaheb says, his eyes lighting up. When you can find a\\nsilver coin in a heap of garbage, you don’t stop scrounging,\\nfor there is hope of finding more. It seems that for children,\\ngarbage has a meaning different from what it means to\\ntheir par ents. For the childr en it is wrapped in wonder , for\\nthe elders it is a means of survival.\\nOne winter morning I see Saheb standing by the fenced\\ngate of the neighbourhood club, watching two young men\\ndressed in white, playing tennis. “I like the game,” he\\nhums, content to watch it standing behind the fence. “I go\\nReprint 2024-25\\n', '16/Flamingo\\ninside when no one is around,” he admits.\\n“The gatekeeper lets me use the swing.”\\nSaheb too is wearing tennis shoes\\nthat look strange over his discoloured\\nshirt and shorts. “Someone gave them\\nto me,” he says in the manner of an\\nexplanation. The fact that they are\\ndiscarded shoes of some rich boy,\\nwho perhaps refused to wear\\nthem because of a hole in one\\nof them, does not bother him.\\nFor one who has walked\\nbarefoot, even shoes with a\\nhole is a dream come true. But\\nthe game he is watching so\\nintently is out of his reach.\\nThis morning, Saheb is on\\nhis way to the milk booth. In\\nhis hand is a steel canister .\\n“I now work in a tea stall down\\nthe road,” he says, pointing in\\nthe distance. “I am paid 800 rupees and all my meals.”\\nDoes he like the job? I ask. His face, I see, has lost the\\ncarefree look. The steel canister seems heavier than the\\nplastic bag he would carry so lightly over his shoulder .\\nThe bag was his.

None of them know\\nthat it is illegal for children like him to work in the glass\\nfurnaces with high temperatures, in dingy cells without air\\nand light; that the law, if enforced, could get him and all\\nthose 20,000 children out of the hot furnaces where they\\nslog their daylight hours, often losing the brightness of their\\neyes. Mukesh’s eyes beam as he volunteers to take me home,\\nwhich he pr oudly says is being r ebuilt.

He stops at the door of one such house,\\nbangs a wobbly iron door with his foot, and pushes it open.\\nWe enter a half-built shack. In one part of it, thatched with\\ndead grass, is a firewood stove over which sits a large vessel\\nof sizzling spinach leaves. On the ground, in large aluminium\\nplatters, are more chopped vegetables. A frail young woman\\nis cooking the evening meal for the whole family. Through\\neyes filled with smoke she smiles. She is the wife of Mukesh’s\\nelder br other . Not much older in years, she has begun to\\ncommand r espect as the bahu , the daughter -in-law of the\\nhouse, already in charge of three men — her husband,\\nMukesh and their father . When the older man enters, she\\ngently withdraws behind the broken wall and brings her\\nveil closer  to her face. As custom demands, daughters-in-\\nlaw must veil their faces before male elders. In this case\\nthe elder is an impoverished bangle maker . Despite long\\nyears of har d labour , first as a tailor , then a bangle maker ,\\nhe has failed to renovate a house, send his two sons to\\nschool. All he has managed to do is teach them what he\\nknows — the art of making bangles.\\n“It is his karam , his destiny,” says Mukesh’s\\ngrandmother , who has watched her own husband go blind\\nwith the dust from polishing the glass of bangles. “Can a\\ngod-given lineage ever be broken?” she implies. Born in\\nthe caste of bangle makers, they have seen nothing but\\nbangles  —  in the house, in the yard, in every other house,\\nevery other yard, every street in Firozabad. Spirals of\\nReprint 2024-25\\n', '18/Flamingo\\nbangles — sunny gold, paddy green, royal blue, pink, purple,\\nevery colour born out of the seven colours of the\\nrainbow — lie in mounds in unkempt yards, are piled on\\nfour-wheeled handcarts, pushed by young men along the\\nnarrow lanes of the shanty town. And in dark hutments,\\nnext to lines of flames of flickering oil lamps, sit boys and\\ngirls with their fathers and mothers, welding pieces of\\ncoloured glass into circles of bangles. Their eyes are more\\nadjusted to the dark than to the light outside. That is why\\nthey often end up losing their eyesight before they become\\nadults.\\nSavita, a young girl in a drab pink dress, sits alongside\\nan elderly woman, soldering pieces of glass. As her hands\\nmove mechanically like the tongs of a machine, I wonder if\\nshe knows the sanctity of the bangles she helps make. It\\nsymbolises an Indian woman’s suhaag , auspiciousness in\\nmarriage. It will dawn on her suddenly one day when her\\nhead is draped with a red veil, her hands dyed red with\\nhenna, and red bangles rolled onto her wrists. She will\\nthen become a bride. Like the old woman beside her who\\nbecame one many years ago. She still has bangles on her\\nwrist, but no light in her eyes. “Ek waqt ser bhar khana bhi\\nnahin khaya,” she says, in a voice drained of joy. She has\\nnot enjoyed even one full meal in her entire lifetime  —\\nthat’s what she has reaped! Her husband, an old man\\nwith a flowing beard, says, “I know nothing except bangles.\\nAll I have done is make a house for the family to live in.”\\nHearing him, one wonders if he has achieved what many\\nhave failed in their lifetime. He has a roof over his head!\\nThe cry of not having money to do anything except\\ncarry on the business of making bangles, not even enough\\nto eat, rings in every home. The young men echo the lament\\nof their elders. Little has moved with time, it seems, in\\nFirozabad.

On each trip across the pool a bit of the\\npanic seized me. Each time the instructor relaxed his hold\\non the r ope and I went under , some of the old terr or returned\\nand my legs froze. It was three months before the tension\\nbegan to slack. Then he taught me to put my face under\\nwater and exhale, and to raise my nose and inhale. I repeated\\nthe exercise hundreds of times.

Outside r oared the\\nwaterfall, and a sharp north wind whipped the rain against\\nthe brick-tiled roof.\\nIt was probably on account of all this noise that the\\nblacksmith did not notice that a man had opened the gate\\nand entered the forge, until he stood close up to the furnace.\\nSurely it was nothing unusual for poor vagabonds\\nwithout any better shelter for the night to be attracted to\\nthe forge by the glow of light which escaped through the\\nsooty panes, and to come in to warm themselves in front of..\\nReprint 2024-25\\n', '36/Flamingo\\nthe fire. The blacksmiths glanced only casually and\\nindifferently at the intruder . He looked the way people of\\nhis type usually did, with a long beard, dirty, ragged, and\\nwith a bunch of rattraps dangling on his chest.\\nHe asked permission to stay, and the master blacksmith\\nnodded a haughty consent without honouring him with a\\nsingle word.\\nThe tramp did not say anything, either . He had not\\ncome there to talk but only to warm himself and sleep.\\nIn those days the Ramsjo iron mill was owned by a\\nvery pr ominent ir onmaster , whose gr eatest ambition was\\nto ship out good iron to the market.

It\\ngrew out of an attempt to alleviate the distress of large\\nnumbers of poor peasants.

The Gemini Studios, located in\\nChennai, was set up in 1940. It was one of the most\\ninfluential film-producing organisations of India in the\\nearly days of Indian film-making. Its founder was S.S.\\nVasan. The duty of Asokamitran in Gemini Studios was\\nto cut out newspaper clippings on a wide variety of\\nsubjects and store them in files. Many of these had to\\nbe written out by hand. Although he performed an\\ninsignificant function he was the most well-informed of\\nall the members of the Gemini family.

For his\\nbrief life and an even briefer stay in Madras, Robert Clive\\nseems to have done a lot of moving, besides fighting some\\nimpossible battles in remote corners of India and marrying\\na maiden in St. Mary’s Church in Fort St. George in\\nMadras.\\nThe mak e-up r oom had the look of a hair -cutting salon\\nwith lights at all angles around half a dozen large mirrors.\\nThey were all incandescent lights, so you can imagine the\\nfiery misery of those subjected to make-up. The make-up\\ndepartment was first headed by a Bengali who became too\\nbig for a studio and left. He was succeeded by a\\nMaharashtrian who was assisted by a Dharwar Kannadiga,\\nan Andhra, a Madras Indian Christian, an Anglo-Burmese\\nand the usual local Tamils. All this shows that there was a\\ngreat deal of national integration long before A.I.R. and\\nDoordarshan began broadcasting programmes on national\\nintegration. This gang of nationally integrated make-up men\\ncould turn any decent-looking person into a hideous crimson\\nhued monster with the help of truck-loads of pancake and a\\nnumber of other locally made potions and lotions. Those\\nwere the days of mainly indoor shooting, and only five\\nper cent of the film was shot outdoors. I suppose the sets\\nand studio lights needed the girls and boys to be made to\\nlook ugly in order to look presentable in the movie. A strict\\nhierarchy was maintained in the\\nmake-up department. The chief\\nmake-up man made the chief actors\\nand actresses ugly, his senior\\nassistant the ‘second’ hero and\\nheroine, the junior assistant the main\\ncomedian, and so forth. The players\\nwho played the crowd were the\\nresponsibility of the office boy. (Even\\nthe make-up department of the\\nGemini Studio had an ‘office boy’!) On\\nthe days when there was a crowd-\\nshooting, you could see him mixing\\nhis paint in a giant vessel and\\nReprint 2024-25\\n', 'Poets and Pancakes /59\\nslapping it on the crowd players. The idea was to close every\\npore on the surface of the face in the process of applying\\nmake-up. He wasn’t exactly a ‘boy’; he was in his early forties,\\nhaving entered the studios years ago in the hope of becoming\\na star actor or a top scr een writer ,\\ndirector or lyrics writer . He was a\\nbit of a poet.\\nIn those days I worked in a\\ncubicle, two whole sides of which\\nwere French windows. (I didn’t\\nknow at that time they were called\\nFrench windows.) Seeing me\\nsitting at my desk tearing up\\nnewspapers day in and day out,\\nmost people thought I was doing\\nnext to nothing. It is likely that\\nthe Boss thought likewise too. So\\nanyone who felt I should be given\\nsome occupation would barge into\\nmy cubicle and deliver an extended lecture. The ‘boy’ in the\\nmake-up department had decided I should be enlightened\\non how great literary talent was being allowed to go waste in\\na department fit only for barbers and perverts. Soon I was\\npraying for crowd -shooting all the time. Nothing short of it\\ncould save me from his epics.\\nIn all instances of frustration, you will always find\\nthe anger directed towards a single person openly or covertly\\nand this man of the make-up department was convinced\\nthat all his woes, ignominy and neglect were due to\\nKothamangalam Subbu. Subbu was the No. 2 at Gemini\\nStudios. He couldn’t have had a more encouraging opening\\nin films than our grown-up make-up boy had. On the\\ncontrary he must have had to face more uncertain and\\ndifficult times, for when he began his car eer, ther e wer e\\nno firmly established film producing companies or studios.\\nEven in the matter of education, specially formal education,\\nSubbu couldn’t have had an appreciable lead over our boy.\\nBut by virtue of being born a Brahmin — a virtue, indeed!\\n— he must have had exposure to more affluent situations\\n1.What does the writer mean by\\n‘the fiery misery’ of those\\nsubjected to make-up’?\\n2.What is the example of\\nnational integration that the\\nauthor refers to?\\n3.What work did the ‘office boy’\\ndo in the Gemini Studios?

He had the ability to look cheerful at all times\\neven after having had a hand in a flop film. He always had\\nwork for somebody — he could never do things on his own\\n— but his sense of loyalty made him identify himself with\\nhis principal completely and turn his entire creativity to\\nhis principal’s advantage. He was tailor -made for films.\\nHere was a man who could be inspired when commanded.\\n“The rat fights the tigress underwater and kills her but\\ntakes pity on the cubs and tends them lovingly — I don’t\\nknow how to do the scene,” the producer would say and\\nSubbu would come out with four ways of the rat pouring\\naffection on its victim’s offspring. “Good, but I am not sure\\nit is effective enough,” the producer would say and in a\\nminute Subbu would come out with fourteen more\\nalternatives. Film-making must have been and was so easy\\nwith a man like Subbu around and if ever there was a man\\nwho gave direction and definition to Gemini Studios during\\nits golden years, it was Subbu. Subbu had a separate\\nidentity as a poet and though he was certainly capable of\\nmore complex and higher forms, he deliberately chose to\\naddress his poetry to the masses. His success in films\\novershadowed and dwarfed his literary achievements — or\\nso his critics felt. He composed several truly original ‘story\\npoems’ in folk refrain and diction and also wrote a sprawling\\nnovel Thillana Mohanambal with dozens of very deftly etched\\ncharacters. He quite successfully recreated the mood and\\nmanner of the Devadasis of the early 20th century. He\\nwas an amazing actor — he never aspired to the lead roles\\n— but whatever subsidiary role he played in any of the\\nfilms, he performed better than the supposed main players.\\nHe had a genuine love for anyone he came across and his\\nhouse was a permanent residence for dozens of near and\\nfar relations and acquaintances. It seemed against Subbu’s\\nnature to be even conscious that he was feeding and\\nsupporting so many of them. Such a charitable and\\nimprovident man, and yet he had enemies! W as it because\\nhe seemed so close and intimate with The Boss? Or was it\\nhis general demeanour that resembled a sycophant’s? Or\\nhis readiness to say nice things about everything? In any\\nReprint 2024-25\\n', 'Poets and Pancakes /61\\ncase, there was this man in the make-up department who\\nwould wish the direst things for Subbu.\\nYou saw Subbu always with The Boss but in the\\nattendance rolls, he was grouped under a department called\\nthe Story Department comprising a lawyer and an assembly\\nof writers and poets. The lawyer was also officially known\\nas the legal adviser , but everybody r eferred to him as the\\nopposite. An extremely talented actress, who was also\\nextremely temperamental, once blew over on the sets. While\\neveryone stood stunned, the lawyer quietly switched on\\nthe recording equipment. When the actress paused for\\nbreath, the lawyer said to her , “One minute, please,” and\\nplayed back the recording. There was nothing incriminating\\nor unmentionably foul about the actress’s tirade against\\nthe pr oducer . But when she hear d her voice again thr ough\\nthe sound equipment, she was struck dumb. A girl from\\nthe countryside, she hadn’t gone through all the stages of\\nworldly experience that generally precede a position of\\nimportance and sophistication that she had found herself\\ncatapulted into. She never quite recovered from the terror\\nshe felt that day. That was the end of a brief and brilliant\\nacting car eer — the legal adviser ,\\nwho was also a member of the\\nStory Department, had\\nunwittingly brought about that\\nsad end. While every other\\nmember of the Department wore\\na kind of uniform — khadi dhoti\\nwith a slightly oversized and\\nclumsily tailored white khadi shirt\\n— the legal adviser wore pants\\nand a tie and sometimes a coat\\nthat looked like a coat of mail.\\nOften he looked alone and\\nhelpless — a man of cold logic in\\na crowd of dreamers — a neutral\\nman in an assembly of Gandhiites\\nand khadiites.

Then one day The Boss closed down the\\nStory Department and this was perhaps the only instance\\nin all human history where a lawyer lost his job because\\nthe poets were asked to go home.\\nGemini Studios was the favourite haunt of poets like\\nS.D.S.Y ogiar3, Sangu Subramanyam, Krishna Sastry and\\nHarindranath Chattopadhyaya4. It had an excellent mess\\nwhich supplied good coffee at all times of the day and for\\nmost part of the night. Those were the days when Congress\\nrule meant Prohibition and meeting over a cup of coffee\\nwas rather satisfying entertainment. Barring the office boys\\nand a couple of clerks, everybody else at the Studios\\nradiated leisure, a pre-requisite for poetry. Most of them\\nwore khadi and worshipped Gandhiji but beyond that they\\nhad not the faintest appreciation for political thought of\\nany kind. Naturally, they were all averse to the term\\n‘Communism’. A Communist was a godless man — he had\\nno filial or conjugal love; he had no compunction about\\nkilling his own parents or his children; he was always out\\nto cause and spread unrest and violence among innocent\\nand ignorant people. Such notions which prevailed\\neverywhere else in South India at that time also, naturally,\\nfloated about vaguely among the khadi-clad poets of Gemini\\nStudios. Evidence of it was soon forthcoming.\\nWhen Frank Buchman’s Moral Re-Armament army,\\nsome two hundred strong, visited Madras sometime in 1952,\\nthey could not have found a warmer host in India than the\\nGemini Studios. Someone called the group an international\\ncircus. They weren’t very good on the trapeze and their\\nacquaintance with animals was only at the dinner table,\\nbut they pr esented two plays in a most pr ofessional manner .\\nTheir ‘Jotham V alley’ and ‘The For gotten Factor’ ran several\\nshows in Madras and along with the other citizens of the\\ncity, the Gemini family of six hundred saw the plays over\\nand over again. The message of the plays were usually\\nplain and simple homilies, but the sets and costumes were\\nfirst-rate. Madras and the Tamil drama community were\\n3.A freedom fighter and a national poet.\\n4.A poet and a playwright.\\nReprint 2024-25\\n', 'Poets and Pancakes /63\\nterribly impressed and for some years almost all Tamil plays\\nhad a scene of sunrise and sunset in the manner of ‘Jotham\\nValley’ with a bar e stage, a white backgr ound curtain and\\na tune played on the flute. It was some years later that I\\nlearnt that the MRA was a kind of counter -movement to\\ninternational Communism and the big bosses of Madras\\nlike Mr . Vasan simply played into their hands. I am not\\nsure however , that this was indeed the case, for the\\nunchangeable aspects of these big bosses and\\ntheir enterprises remained the same, MRA or no MRA,\\ninternational Communism or no international Communism.\\nThe staff of Gemini Studios had a nice time hosting two\\nhundred people of all hues and sizes of at least twenty\\nnationalities. It was such a change from the usual collection\\nof crowd players waiting to be slapped with thick layers of\\nmake-up by the office-boy in the make-up department.\\nA few months later , the telephone lines of the big bosses\\nof Madras buzzed and once again we at Gemini Studios\\nclear ed a whole shooting stage to welcome another visitor .\\nAll they said was that he was a poet from England. The\\nonly poets from England the simple Gemini staff knew or\\nheard of wer e Wordsworth and T ennyson; the mor e literate\\nones knew of Keats, Shelley and Byron; and one or two\\nmight have faintly come to know of someone by the name\\nEliot. Who was the poet visiting the Gemini Studios now?\\n“He is not a poet. He is an editor . That’s why The Boss\\nis giving him a big r eception.” V asan was also the editor of\\nthe popular Tamil weekly Ananda Vikatan .\\nHe wasn’t the editor of any of the known names of\\nBritish publications in Madras, that is, those known at\\nthe Gemini Studios. Since the top men of The Hindu were\\ntaking the initiative, the surmise was that the poet was\\nthe editor of a daily — but not from The Manchester Guardian\\nor the London T imes. That was all that even the most well-\\ninformed among us knew.\\nAt last, around four in the afternoon, the poet (or the\\neditor) arrived. He was a tall man, very English, very serious\\nand of course very unknown to all of us.

The whole thing lasted about\\nan hour; then the poet left and we\\nall dispersed in utter bafflement —\\nwhat are we doing? What is an\\nEnglish poet doing in a film studio\\nwhich makes Tamil films for the\\nsimplest sort of people? People whose\\nlives least afforded them the\\npossibility of cultivating a taste for English poetry? The poet\\nlooked pretty baffled too, for he too must have felt the sheer\\nincongruity of his talk about the thrills and travails of an English\\npoet. His visit remained an unexplained mystery.\\nThe great prose-writers of the world may not admit it,\\nbut my conviction grows stronger day after day that prose-\\nwriting is not and cannot be the true pursuit of a genius.\\nIt is for the patient, persistent, persevering drudge with a\\nheart so shrunken that nothing can break it; rejection\\nslips don’t mean a thing to him; he at once sets about\\nmaking a fresh copy of the long prose piece and sends it on\\nto another editor enclosing postage for the return of the\\nmanuscript. It was for such people that The Hindu had\\npublished a tiny announcement in an insignificant corner\\nof an unimportant page — a short story contest organised\\nby a British periodical by the name The Encounter . Of course,\\nThe Encounter wasn’t a known commodity among the Gemini\\nliterati. I wanted to get an idea of the periodical before I\\nspent a considerable sum in postage sending a manuscript\\nReprint 2024-25\\n', 'Poets and Pancakes /65\\nto England. In those days, the British Council Library had\\nan entrance with no long winded signboards and notices to\\nmake you feel you were sneaking into a forbidden area.\\nAnd there were copies of The Encounter lying about in\\nvarious degrees of freshness, almost untouched by readers.\\nWhen I read the editor’s name, I heard a bell ringing in my\\nshrunken heart.

He was a reporter for Private\\nEye for ten years and has written featur es for Vanity\\nFair. Following is an excerpt taken fr om his intr oduction\\nto the Penguin Book of Interviews, An Anthology from\\n1859 to the Present Day.\\nPart I\\nSince its invention a little over 130 years ago, the interview\\nhas become a commonplace of journalism. Today, almost\\neverybody who is literate will have read an interview at\\nsome point in their lives, while from the other point of\\nview, several thousand celebrities have been interviewed\\nover the years, some of them repeatedly. So it is hardly\\nsurprising that opinions of the interview — of its functions,\\nmethods and merits — vary considerably. Some might make\\nquite extravagant claims for it as being, in its highest form,\\na source of truth, and, in its practice, an art. Others,\\nusually celebrities who see themselves as its victims, might\\ndespise the interview as an unwarranted intrusion into\\ntheir lives, or feel that it somehow diminishes them, just\\nas in some primitive cultures it is believed that if one\\ntakes a photographic portrait of somebody then one is\\nstealing that person’s soul. V . S. Naipaul1 ‘feels that some\\npeople are wounded by interviews and lose a part of\\nthemselves,’ Lewis Carroll, the creator of Alice in\\nWonderland, was said to have had ‘a just horr or of the\\ninterviewer’ and he never consented to be interviewed — It7\\n1.Known as a cosmopolitan writer . In his travel books and in his documentary works he\\npresents his impressions of the country of his ancestors that is India. He received the Nobel\\nPrize in Literature in 2001.\\nReprint 2024-25\\n', 'The Interview /69\\nwas his horror of being lionized which made him thus repel\\nwould be acquaintances, interviewers, and the persistent\\npetitioners for his autograph and he would afterwards\\nrelate the stories of his success in silencing all such people\\nwith much satisfaction and amusement. Rudyard Kipling2\\nexpressed an even more condemnatory attitude towards\\nthe interviewer . His wife, Car oline, writes in her diary for\\n14 October 1892 that their day was ‘wrecked by two reporters\\nfrom Boston’. She reports her husband as saying to the\\nreporters, “Why do I refuse to be interviewed? Because it\\nis immoral! It is a crime, just as much of a crime as an\\noffence against my person, as an assault, and just as much\\nmerits punishment. It is cowardly and vile. No respectable\\nman would ask it, much less give it,” Y et Kipling had\\nhimself perpetrated such an ‘assault’ on Mark Twain only\\na few years befor e. H. G. W ells3 in an interview in 1894\\nreferred to ‘the interviewing\\nordeal’, but was a fairly frequent\\ninterviewee and forty years later\\nfound himself interviewing\\nJoseph Stalin4. Saul Bellow5, who\\nhas consented to be interviewed\\non several occasions, nevertheless\\nonce described interviews as\\nbeing like thumbprints on his\\nwindpipe. Y et despite the\\ndrawbacks of the interview, it is\\na supremely serviceable medium\\nof communication. “These days,\\nmore than at any other time,\\nour most vivid impressions of\\nour contemporaries are through\\n2.A prolific writer who was known as the poet of the common soldier .

Because of this, the interviewer holds a position\\nof unprecedented power and influence.”\\nPart II\\n“I am a professor who writes novels on Sundays” –Umberto Eco\\nThe following is an extract from an interview of Umberto\\nEco. The interviewer is Mukund Padmanabhan from\\nThe Hindu . Umberto Eco, a professor at the University\\nof Bologna in Italy had already acquired a formidable\\nreputation as a scholar for his ideas on semiotics (the\\nstudy of signs), literary interpretation, and medieval\\naesthetics before he turned to writing fiction. Literary\\nfiction, academic texts, essays, children’s books,\\nnewspaper article s—his written output is staggeringly\\nlarge and wide-ranging, In 1980, he acquired the\\nequivalent of intellectual superstardom with the\\npublication of The Name of the Rose , which sold more\\nthan 10 million copies.\\nMukund: The English novelist and academic David Lodge\\nonce remarked, “I can’t understand how one man\\ncan do all the things he [Eco] does.”\\nUmberto Eco:  Maybe I give the impression of doing many\\nthings. But in the end, I am convinced I am always\\ndoing the same thing.\\nMukund: Which is?\\nUmberto Eco: Aah, now that is more difficult to explain.\\nI have some philosophical interests and I pursue\\nthem through my academic work and my novels.\\nEven my books for children are about non-violence\\nand peace...you see, the same bunch of ethical,\\nphilosophical interests.\\nAnd then I have a secret. Did you know what will\\nhappen if you eliminate the empty spaces from the\\nuniverse, eliminate the empty spaces in all the\\natoms? The universe will become as big as my fist.\\nReprint 2024-25\\n', 'The Interview /71\\nSimilarly, we have a lot of empty spaces in our\\nlives. I call them interstices. Say you are coming\\nover to my place. Y ou ar e in an elevator and while\\nyou are coming up, I am waiting for you. This is an\\ninterstice, an empty space. I work in empty spaces.\\nWhile waiting for your elevator to come up from\\nthe first to the thir d floor , I have alr eady written\\nan article! ( Laughs ).\\nMukund: Not everyone can do that of course. Y our\\nnon-fictional writing, your scholarly work has a\\ncertain playful and personal quality about it. It is\\na marked departure from a regular academic\\nstyle — which is invariably depersonalised and\\noften dry and boring. Have you consciously adopted\\nan informal approach or is it something that just\\ncame naturally to you?\\nUmberto Eco: When I presented my first Doctoral\\ndissertation in Italy, one of the Professors said,\\n“Scholars learn a lot of a certain subject, then they\\nmake a lot of false hypotheses, then they correct them\\nand at the end, they put the conclusions. Y ou, on the\\ncontrary, told the story of your research. Even including\\nyour trials and errors.” At the same time, he recognised\\nI was right and went on to publish my dissertation as\\na book, which meant he appreciated it.\\nAt that point, at the age of 22, I understood\\nscholarly books should be written the way I had\\ndone — by telling the story of the research. This is\\nwhy my essays always have a narrative aspect.\\nAnd this is why probably I started writing narratives\\n[novels] so late — at the age of 50, more or less.\\nI remember that my dear friend Roland Barthes\\nwas always frustrated that he was an essayist and\\nnot a novelist. He wanted to do creative writing\\none day or another but he died before he could do\\nso. I never felt this kind of frustration. I started\\nwriting novels by accident. I had nothing to do one\\nReprint 2024-25\\n', '72/Flamingo\\nday and so I started. Novels probably satisfied my\\ntaste for narration.\\nMukund: Talking about novels, from being a famous\\nacademic you went on to becoming spectacularly\\nfamous after the publication of The Name of the\\nRose. You’ve written five novels against many mor e\\nscholarly works of non-fiction, at least more than\\n20 of them...\\nUmberto Eco: Over 40.\\nMukund: Over 40! Among them a seminal piece of work\\non semiotics. But ask most people about Umberto\\nEco and they will say, “Oh, he’s the novelist.” Does\\nthat bother you?\\nUmberto Eco: Y es. Because I consider myself a\\nuniversity professor who writes novels on Sundays.\\nIt’s not a joke. I participate in academic conferences\\nand not meetings of Pen Clubs and writers. I\\nidentify myself with the academic community.\\nBut okay, if they [most people] have read only the\\nnovels... ( laughs and shrugs ). I know that by writing\\nnovels, I reach a larger audience. I cannot expect\\nto have one million readers with stuff on semiotics.\\nMukund: Which brings me to my next question. The\\nName of the Rose is a very serious novel. It’s a\\ndetective yarn at one level but it also delves into\\nmetaphysics, theology, and medieval history. Y et\\nit enjoyed a huge mass audience. W ere you puzzled\\nat all by this?\\nUmberto Eco: No. Journalists are puzzled. And\\nsometimes publishers. And this is because\\njournalists and publishers believe that people like\\ntrash and don’t like difficult reading experiences.\\nConsider there are six billion people on this planet.\\nThe Name of the Rose  sold between 10 and 15\\nmillion copies. So in a way I reached only a small\\nReprint 2024-25\\n', 'The Interview /73\\npercentage of readers. But it is exactly these kinds\\nof readers who don’t want easy experiences. Or at\\nleast don’t always want this. I myself, at 9 pm after\\ndinner , watch television and want to see either\\n‘Miami Vice’ or ‘Emergency Room’. I enjoy it and I\\nneed it. But not all day.\\nMukund: Could the huge success of the novel have\\nanything to do with the fact that it dealt with a\\nperiod of medieval history that...\\nUmberto Eco: That’s possible. But let me tell you\\nanother story, because I often tell stories like a\\nChinese wise man. My American publisher said\\nwhile she loved my book, she didn’t expect to sell\\nmore than 3,000 copies in a country where nobody\\nhas seen a cathedral or studies Latin. So I was\\ngiven an advance for 3,000 copies, but in the end\\nit sold two or three million in the U.S.\\nA lot of books have been written about the medieval\\npast far before mine. I think the success of the\\nbook is a mystery. Nobody can predict it.

Whether they were only the outlying districts\\nReprint 2024-25\\n', 'Going Places /79\\nof the city, or places beyond in the surrounding country —\\nwho knew?  — they attained a special fascination simply\\nbecause they were unknown to her and remained out of\\nher reach.\\nPerhaps there were also people, exotic, interesting\\npeople of whom he never spoke — it was possible, though\\nhe was quiet and didn’t make new friends easily.
